<h2>Welcome To My Page</h2><br>
<p>The end of summer always feels like the beginning of a new year for me.
    <span class="br">When I was a kid it was, quite literally â€” my new year of school always started after Labor Day.
    But even now, when the summer starts to wind down, I start thinking about my plans for the "new year"</span>

   <i><b>This year while I was making those plans, I decided that it's time to bring Code it Pretty to a close.</b></i>

    There's no big standout reason why.
    It's a bunch of little reasons that all boil down to time.
    The time I would spend on Code it Pretty is time I want for other things now.</p>
